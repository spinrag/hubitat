# SignalBricks Telemetry

A Hubitat Elevation app that sends read-only device telemetry to [SignalBricks](https://app.signalbricks.co): lock state, contact sensors, temperature, humidity, and battery levels.

It runs alongside the **SignalBricks Integration** (lock-code) app. The two apps are independent. This one never controls devices.

## Requirements

- Hubitat Elevation platform **2.5.0** or later
- A SignalBricks account with the **admin** role in the organization that owns the property

## Install

### Hubitat Package Manager (recommended)

1. Open **Hubitat Package Manager** on your hub.
2. Choose **Install** → **Search by Keywords** and search for `SignalBricks`.
3. Select **SignalBricks Telemetry** and follow the prompts. HPM enables OAuth for the app code automatically.

### Manual

1. In **Apps Code**, click **New App**, paste [`app.groovy`](app.groovy), and click **Save**.
2. Click **OAuth** → **Enable OAuth in App** → **Update**.
3. In **Apps** → **Add User App**, choose **SignalBricks Telemetry**.

## Connect

1. Open **SignalBricks Telemetry**. It appears under **Integrations**.
2. Select the locks and sensors you want to report, then click **Done** and reopen the app.
3. Click **Connect to SignalBricks**. Sign in, then choose the **organization**, **property**, and **hub**. If this hub was connected before, it is preselected. You can also create a new hub entry. If the organization has no properties yet, you can create one on the same page.
   - If you work for a management company, choose the **property owner's organization**. Hubs belong to the owner, not the management company.
4. After you approve, Hubitat sends you back to the app. A confirmation page appears, and the app shows **Status: Connected**.

**Reconnect** issues a new token and revokes the previous one. **Disconnect** stops sending right away. To revoke the token on the SignalBricks side as well, remove it under **Tokens** in the portal.

## Events sent

| Devices | Attributes |
|---|---|
| Locks | `lock`, `lastCodeName`, `battery` |
| Contact sensors | `contact`, `battery` |
| Temperature sensors | `temperature`, `battery` |
| Humidity sensors | `humidity`, `battery` |

Each event is sent with `asynchttpPost` to the SignalBricks ingestion API (`https://ingest.signalbricks.co/v1/webhooks/hubitat`) using `Authorization: Bearer <token>`. Each event includes the device id and name, the attribute name and value, the unit, the description text, the event time, and the app version.

## Privacy

- **No PINs.** The app never subscribes to `lockCodes` and never reads or sends lock codes. `lastCodeName` is the *name* of the code that was used (for example, a guest or booking label), not the code.
- **Read-only.** The app sends no device commands and exposes no device-control endpoints. Its only endpoint is the one-time `/oauthCallback` used during Connect.
- **No shared secret.** Connect uses OAuth with PKCE (S256), so the app doesn't need to store a client secret. The hub's own app access token in the OAuth `state` is used only by Hubitat cloud to route the callback, and is never logged.
- Events go only to the ingestion URL that SignalBricks returned during Connect. Nothing is sent until the hub is connected.

## Troubleshooting

- **"OAuth is not enabled for this app"**: enable OAuth for the app code (see Manual install, step 2).
- **"SignalBricks rejected the token"**: the token was revoked in the portal. Click **Reconnect to SignalBricks**.
- Turn on **debug logging** to see each event as it is sent. Debug logging turns itself off after 30 minutes.
